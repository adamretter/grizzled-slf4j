Addressed [Issue #5][] via a patch provided by [Lucas Torri][]. Specifically,
the `Logger` object now supports this method:

    def apply[T](implicit m: Manifest[T]): Logger = apply(m.erasure)

Allowing this syntax:

    val logger = Logger[MyClass]

**Note**: As a result of this change, Grizzled SLF4J no longer supports
Scala 2.7.
