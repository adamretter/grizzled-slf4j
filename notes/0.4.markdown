* Updated to version 1.6.1 of the [SLF4J][] library.
* Added a `Logging` trait that can be mixed into a class, providing logging
  functions and a `Logger`, without changing the public API (similar to the
  [Logging][scalate-logging] trait in the [Scalate][] source). Addresses
  [Issue #1][issue-1].
